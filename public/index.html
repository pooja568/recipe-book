        <p>The sandwich as we know it was popularized in England in 1762 by John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich. Legend has it, and most food historians agree, that Montagu had a substantial gambling problem that led him to spend hours on end at the card table. During a particularly long binge, he asked the house cook to bring him something he could eat without getting up from his seat, and the sandwich was born. Montagu enjoyed his meat and bread so much that he ate it constantly, and as the concoction grew popular in London society circles it also took on the Earl’s name.</p>

    <p> 1) Whole-Grain Bread
        <br>
        <br>
        To set this sandwich apart from all the rest, start with freshly baked bread. Store-bought brands can be tasty and convenient, but when you’re only working with 5 ingredients, you want them to be the best. For this recipe, I stopped by the Sono Baking Company and picked up a loaf of whole-wheat sourdough — choose any whole grain variety for extra hunger-fighting fiber.

        <br>
        
        2) Hummus
        <br>
        <br>
        This is the secret ingredient. Just a little bit of smooth and creamy hummus adds amazing texture, flavor, protein and healthy fat — way better than the saturated fat in mayo! I had some homemade hummus in the fridge, but you can also use store-bought. I like to buy the plain kind and jazz it up myself with fresh herbs, hot sauce or a spoonful of pesto.
        
        Place bread slices on a plate (toasting is optional), and spread each with 1/2 tablespoon of hummus.<br>
        <br>
        
        3) Cucumber
        <br>
        <br>
        Fresh cucumbers add a cool crunch for virtually no calories (one cup has only 15, so pile them on). For sandwiches, I like to slice them lengthwise to prevent sliding –- use a hand-held mandoline for perfectly even cuts. Save leftovers for snacking or a cucumber salad. To take advantage of all the nutrients in cucumbers (including vitamins K and C), eat the skin. Just avoid the waxy ones –- go for the English or “hothouse” kinds or, better yet, get them fresh from the garden or a local farm.<br>
        <br>
        
        4) Tomato
        <br>
        <br>
        ‘Tis the season for fresh tomatoes! A few thin slices give this sammy color, mouthwatering flavor and some vitamin C. I used a plump and juicy heirloom tomato fresh from the farmers’ market.
        
        Layer cucumber and tomato on one slice of bread and sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper.<br>
        <br>
        
        5) Low-fat Cheese
        <br>
        <br>
        I love cheese, but it can be high in calories, fat and cholesterol. Thanks to low-fat versions (there are a ton of good ones available nowadays) you can enjoy tasty cheese without the worry. A mild cheese such as muenster or havarti adds creamy, cheesy goodness to this dish — plus, some calcium and protein.
        
        Lay one slice of cheese over the tomato. Top with the remaining slice of bread, cut in half and serve.  </p>

        <div class="dish-description ">

        <p> In the 1st century AD writings of Horace, lagana were fine sheets of fried dough and were an everyday foodstuff. Writing in the 2nd century Athenaeus of Naucratis provides a recipe for lagana which he attributes to the 1st century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavoured with spices and deep-fried in oil.An early 5th century cookbook describes a dish called lagana that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, an ancestor of modern-day lasagna.However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to our modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape.The first concrete information concerning pasta products in Italy dates from the 13th or 14th century. </p>

<div class="dish-description ">

<p> The first mention of kheer, which historians say was derived from the Sanksrit word kshirika (meaning a dish prepared with milk), is found in the fourteenth century Padmavat of Gugarat, not as a rice pudding but a sweet preparation of jowar and milk. Back then using millets in pudding was quite common. </p>
